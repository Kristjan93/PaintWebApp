# PaintWebApp
> 'Masterfully' designed microsoft paint inspired application.

# See the application in action


## Background
This application was built using pure object-oriented design in javaScript and the HTML5 canvas element.

## Functionality
You can add predefined primitive drawing objects that work similarly as in most drawing programs.
  * circle
  * rectangle
  * line
  * text
  * pen (i.e. a freehand drawing)

You can manipulate various properties of the drawing objects.
These properties are fixed(unchangeable) once the object is drawn.  **All except move**. 
  * color
  * line size
  * font (only with text)
  * move

General workflow functionality is possible such as
  * undo and redo
  * save drawing 
  * clear canvas
